Dumbell Charts showing bookmaker maximum and minimum odds

Upon looking for free datasets with sports/football data, I came across www.football-data.co.uk. This site provides historical betting information from 22 European leagues going back to 1993/94. Files can be downloaded with each CSV containing data such as results, match stats and bookmaker odds. I downloaded complete data for the 2017/2018 English Championship season. Looking at the minimum and maximum odds for each teamsâ€™ results, I set out to create a dumbbell chart. By ordering teams in their finishing positions, it could provide a visualisation of whether the bookies had got the odds right. 

The data was wrangled in R and graphed using ggplot2 and ggalt.
