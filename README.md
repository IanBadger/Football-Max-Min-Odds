Dumbell Charts showing bookmaker maximum and minimum odds

Upon looking for free datasets with sports/football data, I came across xxx football-info.com. This site provides historical betting information from xxx leagues. Files can be downloaded with each CSV containing data such as results, match stats and bookmaker odds. I dowloaded complete data for the 2017/2018 English Championship season. Looking at the minimum and maximum odds for each teamsâ€™ results, I set out to create a dumbbell chart. By ordering teams in their finishing positions, it could provide a visualisation of whether the bookies had got the odds right.
